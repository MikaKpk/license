# Mika K. Content License (MKCL)

## 1: Application of the License

This is a license that applies to most content created and distributed by me over several platforms unless the the license sepecifically for that content says otherwise.

The license may only apply to work actually done by me. In case a product is 
*  derived and remixed from another product with its own licensing terms
*  an addition to another product with its own licensing terms
other terms might apply. If a product is a modification of a existing product, then, unless stated differently, both this license and the original license of the product apply with the more restrictive parts of the licenses having priority unless the original license of the product prevents parts of this license.

This means, if a image was altered by me and the images original license requires that all modifications of it must also be freely modifyable by other authors, then the regulations for modifications in this license take no effect.

If a product is an addition to a existing product, then this license applies fully for the addition itself, and distribution of the now modified full product is subject to the remix rule above.

This means if I add another brand new image made by me to an image collection, the single image itself is bound to this license, but the now modified image collection as a whole is only partially affected.
